Software Requirements Specification: Personalized Fitness Application (Do IT)1. Introduction

This document comprehensively outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for a cutting-edge personalized fitness and diet application, tentatively named "Do IT." The primary objective of this application is to empower users to achieve their health and fitness aspirations by providing highly customized workout routines and nutritional meal plans. These plans will be intelligently generated based on a detailed understanding of each user's unique profile, including their physical attributes and explicitly stated fitness goals. Furthermore, the application will incorporate a flexible subscription model, offering various tiers to cater to diverse user needs, including a premium option that integrates a dedicated personal coaching service for enhanced guidance and accountability.2. User Registration and Profile Management

The initial user experience is designed to be seamless and informative, guiding new users through the essential steps of setting up their personalized profile.

**2.1. Welcome Screen:** Upon the very first launch of the application, users will be greeted by an engaging and aesthetically pleasing welcome screen. This screen will serve as an introduction to the application's core value proposition and encourage users to begin their fitness journey.

**2.2. Language Selection:** Recognizing the diverse user base, the application will provide a prominent and easily accessible language selection option. Users will be able to choose their preferred language between English and Arabic, ensuring a comfortable and intuitive interaction from the outset.

**2.3. User Data Collection:** To facilitate the creation of highly personalized fitness and diet plans, the application will systematically collect essential personal information from each user. This data collection will be presented as a mandatory step in the profile creation process, with clear explanations of how the information will be utilized. The required fields include:

* **First Name:** For personalized greetings and communication.  
* **Last Name:** For formal identification and record-keeping.  
* **Gender (Male/Female):** Crucial for gender-specific physiological considerations in workout and diet plan generation.  
* **Weight (in kg/lbs):** A fundamental metric for calorie calculations, BMI assessment, and progress tracking.  
* **Height (in cm/inches):** Essential for BMI calculation and influencing recommended water intake.  
* **Age (in years):** Impacts metabolic rate, exercise intensity recommendations, and nutritional needs.  
* **Email Address:** For account verification, password recovery, and important application notifications.  
* **Phone Number:** For potential personal coaching contact in premium tiers and other relevant communications.

**2.4. User Goal Selection:** A pivotal aspect of personalization is understanding the user's primary fitness objective. The application will present a clear and concise selection of common fitness goals, allowing users to specify their aspirations. These options will directly influence the algorithms used to generate tailored plans:

* **Lose Weight:** Focus on calorie deficit and exercises promoting fat loss.  
* **Gain Weight:** Focus on calorie surplus and exercises promoting muscle and healthy weight gain.  
* **Gain Muscle:** Focus on resistance training and protein-rich diet plans.  
* **Other specialized diet plans (e.g., "Extra Diet"):** This option will cater to more niche or advanced dietary preferences or restrictions, allowing for future expansion of specialized plans (e.g., ketogenic, vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, etc.). Users selecting this option may be prompted for further details.

**2.5. Profile Media (Optional):** To enhance the user's profile and provide a visual representation of their journey, the application will offer an optional feature for uploading profile media. Users can choose to:

* **Upload a profile photo:** For a personalized touch within the application interface.  
* **Upload progress videos:** Allowing users to visually track their physical transformation over time, which can serve as a powerful motivational tool.

3\. Core Application Features

Upon successful profile setup, users will be seamlessly directed to their personalized main dashboard, serving as the central hub for their fitness journey.

**3.1. Main Dashboard:** The main dashboard will be designed for clarity and ease of navigation, presenting two primary and distinct pathways for the user:

* **Training Program:** This option will lead users directly to their personalized workout routines, exercise details, and progress tracking related to their physical activity.  
* **Diet/Eating Plan:** This option will provide access to their customized meal plans, nutritional information, calorie targets, and hydration goals.

**3.2. Program Generation:** The cornerstone of the "Do IT" application is its intelligent program generation engine. The application must possess the capability to automatically and dynamically generate highly personalized training and diet plans. This generation will be meticulously crafted based on a comprehensive analysis of the user's previously inputted profile data (including height, weight, age, and gender) and their explicitly selected primary fitness goal. The algorithms will factor in these parameters to ensure optimal and safe recommendations.4. Diet and Nutrition Plan Module

The Diet and Nutrition Plan Module is designed to provide users with comprehensive and actionable guidance on their dietary intake, crucial for achieving their fitness goals.

**4.1. Personalized Meal Plans:** The system will generate a detailed, day-by-day meal plan. Each daily plan will specify a recommended number of meals (e.g., five meals per day), distributed appropriately to support the user's metabolic needs and fitness objectives. Each meal will include specific food recommendations, portion sizes, and preparation suggestions.

**4.2. Calorie Calculation:** A core function of the diet module is the accurate calculation of a daily calorie target. This target will be dynamically determined based on the user's profile data (age, gender, weight, height, activity level, and fitness goal) using scientifically recognized formulas (e.g., Mifflin-St Jeor, Harris-Benedict). The diet plan will be meticulously constructed to adhere to this calculated calorie target, ensuring it supports either a calorie deficit for weight loss, a surplus for weight gain, or maintenance for muscle gain.

**4.3. BMI Calculation:** For health awareness and progress tracking, the system will automatically calculate and prominently display the user's Body Mass Index (BMI). This will provide a quick reference point for their general health category (underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese).

**4.4. Hydration Goals:** Recognizing the critical role of hydration in overall health and fitness, the application will calculate and recommend a personalized daily water intake goal. This recommendation, presented in liters, will vary based on the user's height, weight, and fitness goals, with higher recommendations for those engaging in intense workouts or aiming for significant weight changes.5. Training and Workout Module

The Training and Workout Module will guide users through effective and personalized exercise routines, ensuring proper form and maximizing results.

**5.1. Personalized Workout Plans:** The application will provide users with daily workout routines tailored to their specific fitness goals. Each workout plan will clearly specify the primary muscle groups to be targeted for that particular day (e.g., Day 1: Chest and Biceps, Day 2: Back and Triceps, Day 3: Legs and Shoulders, etc.). This structured approach promotes balanced muscle development and prevents overtraining.

**5.2. Exercise Details:** For every single exercise included within the workout plan, the application must provide comprehensive and easily digestible details to ensure user comprehension and proper execution:

* **Number of sets:** Clearly indicating the number of repetitions to be performed for each exercise.  
* **Number of repetitions per set:** This crucial parameter will be dynamically adjusted based on the user's specific fitness goal. For instance, higher repetitions with lighter weights will be recommended for weight loss and muscular endurance, while lower repetitions with heavier weights will be prescribed for muscle gain and strength development.  
* **An instructional photo for each exercise:** High-quality, clear static images demonstrating the correct starting and ending positions of each exercise.  
* **An instructional video for each exercise:** Short, high-definition video demonstrations of each exercise, illustrating proper form, range of motion, and common pitfalls to avoid. These videos will be accessible directly within the application, eliminating the need for external searches.

6\. Subscription and Monetization

The "Do IT" application will implement a clear and value-driven subscription model to ensure sustainability and provide users with tiered access to features.

**6.1. Subscription Tiers:** The application will offer two distinct monthly subscription packages, each designed to cater to different user needs and commitment levels.
